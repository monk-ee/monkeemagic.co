### Who?, What? How?
I am an automation evangelist who gets really excited about technology and systems.

I assist businesses in the transition between traditional infrastructure and management to virtualized automated systems.

There are a lot of cloud systems on offer, but the linkages that tie your business to their system, never seem to exist.

I see these gaps as exciting places to build, make and deploy!
